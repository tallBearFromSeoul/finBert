# Financial Sentiment Analysis and Stock Return Prediction
This project leverages FinBERT for sentiment analysis on financial news headlines and integrates it with deep learning models to predict next-day stock returns. It builds upon the methodology in [Financial Sentiment Analysis Using FinBERT with Application in Predicting Stock Movement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02136) (arXiv:2306.02136v3), which focused on predicting next-day closing prices, whereas this work targets next-day returns to better capture relative market movements. The goal is to demonstrate how sentiment-enhanced features improve prediction accuracy over vanilla models.
## Part 1: Sentiment Scoring and Fine-Tuning
I scored sentiments from headlines in the "Daily Financial News for 6000+ Stocks" dataset (Kaggle), covering over 1 million entries up to 2019. Each headline was processed using pre-trained FinBERT (`ProsusAI/finbert`) to extract probabilities for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The daily aggregated sentiment score per ticker is calculated as:
$$ \text{SentimentScore}_t = \frac{1}{N_t} \sum_{n=1}^{N_t} [P_n(\text{positive}) - P_n(\text{negative})] $$
where \(N_t\) is the number of articles on day \(t\).
To adapt FinBERT for financial tasks, I fine-tuned it using the Numerical Sentiment Index (NSI) derived from historical stock prices (via yfinance API). NSI quantifies market-based sentiment as:
$$ \text{NSI}_t = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \text{return}_t > s \\
0 & \text{if } -s \leq \text{return}_t \leq s \\
-1 & \text{if } \text{return}_t < -s
\end{cases} $$
with \(\text{return}_t = \frac{\text{ClosePrice}_t - \text{OpenPrice}_t}{\text{OpenPrice}_t}\) and threshold \(s = 0.01\). This fine-tuning aligns textual sentiment with actual market movements, enhancing domain-specific accuracy.
Post-fine-tuning, I analyzed the distribution of sentiment scores across tickers, which often exhibited a slight positive skew (mean around 0.1-0.3 for most stocks), reflecting optimistic financial news bias. I selected tickers with sufficient data points (e.g., >500) and balanced distributions for statistical significance, avoiding those with extreme sentiment clustering that could bias predictions.
For comprehensiveness, I also examined the distribution of daily stock returns from the historical data. Returns typically followed a leptokurtic pattern (fat tails, kurtosis >3), indicating higher volatility and outlier events compared to a normal distribution. This informed feature engineering, such as incorporating volatility measures in lagged features to capture non-stationary behaviors.
Visualizations for each ticker include: time series of SentimentScore (point size proportional to \(N_t\), with vertical lines and overlaid daily returns), histogram of SentimentScore (with stats: N, min, max, mean), OHLC candlestick chart (with open/high/low/close lines), and volume bars (colored by bullish/bearish).

## Part 2: Predictive Modeling with Sentiment Features
Using the fine-tuned sentiment scores, I constructed daily features: sentiment score + lagged OHLCV market features (open, high, low, close, volume) over a look-back window (e.g., 60 days), aligned with the paper's approach. Features were normalized using MinMax scaling to [0,1] for stable training across varying scales. Unlike the paper's focus on predicting next-day closing prices, the target here is the next day's return (\(\text{return}_{t+1}\)), normalized similarly to handle scale differences across tickers and emphasize relative changes. Only data points with available sentiment were used, ensuring alignment between news and market data.
I trained regressors on chronological splits (90% train, 10% test), comparing:
- **Vanilla models**: Lagged features only (no sentiment).
- **Sentiment-enhanced models**: Including sentiment score.
Models evaluated:
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: Basic sequential model capturing temporal dependencies via hidden states; suitable for time-series but prone to vanishing gradients over long sequences.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Improves RNN by adding gates (forget, input, output) to handle long-term dependencies and mitigate vanishing gradients; ideal for financial time-series with non-linear patterns and persistent autocorrelations.
- **TabMLP (Tabular Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: Feed-forward neural network for tabular data; excels in capturing feature interactions via dense layers without explicit sequencing, serving as a non-recurrent baseline to benchmark against recurrent architectures.
Training used MSE loss, Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001, with decay), batch size 1 (beneficial for capturing fine-grained patterns in sequential data, despite noisier gradient updates, as per the paper), and early stopping (patience 20) based on validation loss (10% of train). No regularization was applied to maintain model simplicity given small per-ticker datasets, relying on early stopping to prevent overfitting without suppressing learning on limited signals. Hyperparameters were tuned via grid search for stability.
## Results
### Performance Metrics
Metrics for train/validation/test sets (MSE, MAE, RMSE). Lower values indicate better performance, with sentiment models showing consistent reductions in error (e.g., -% MSE improvement on test set for RNN on Stock 1, -% for LSTM, etc.), highlighting sentiment's role in explaining return variance beyond lagged features.

### Visual Comparisons
Plots show predicted vs. actual returns, highlighting sentiment's impact. For comprehensiveness, comparisons reveal how sentiment helps models better fit fat-tailed return distributions, reducing underprediction during volatile periods. In some cases, vanilla models failed to learn meaningful patterns, outputting nearly flat predictions around 0 (essentially the mean return), due to insufficient signal from lagged features alone in noisy, non-stationary data. Adding just the single sentiment score from that day's news headlines to the same model architecture significantly improved accuracy, enabling capture of short-term sentiment-driven movements (e.g., test MSE reduced from to for [model] on [stock]).
